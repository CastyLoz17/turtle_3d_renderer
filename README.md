# turtle_3d_renderer
3d renderer using turtle and math. 
download all the files (yes, even the obj), and run the renderer! remember to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` before you run the code!

## note to mac users (or anybody who cant use renderer.py due to errors with `import mouse`:
run renderer_mac.py instead! renderer_mac.py uses pynput instead of mouse, so camera rotation would be a bit choppy.
