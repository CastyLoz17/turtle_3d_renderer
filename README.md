# turtle_3d_renderer

3d renderer using turtle and math.
download all the files (yes, even the obj), and run the renderer! remember to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` before you run the code!

## OR

just like run the exe file

## note:

this is actually importable into projects, so if you ever want to use this shitty renderer instead of smth normal like opengl or pandas3d or a renderer built with numpy, you can always `import renderer`!
